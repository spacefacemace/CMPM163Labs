<b>Kart Game Modifications</b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Skybox</b>
<p>I created a new material and made it into a six-sided skybox using the preset attribute. I assigned the sky textures I found from the Unity Asset Store to the six corresponding sides and made it a "lighting" feature in the world.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<b>Rainbow Trail</b>
<p>
I used the premade Unity rainbow trail asset and made the assets the children of the four wheel objects so that they move with the kart.

</li>
</ul>
